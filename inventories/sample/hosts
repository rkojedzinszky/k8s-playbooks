# Two groups must exist:
#  cluster - contains _ALL_ nodes, even masters
#  master  - contains only master nodes
#
#  Therefore an example inventory might look like:
[cluster:children]
master
#infra
worker

# All hosts might have an ip= argument. If defined, some daemons will bind only to this address.
# Also, the watchdog will use that address
[master]
k8s-master

#[infra]
#infra-1

[worker]
k8s-node-1
k8s-node-2
# For a node you can specify the InternalIP/node-IP to be used with
# kubernetes_node_ip. This will get passed to kubelet with --node-ip.
k8s-node-3 kubernetes_node_ip=10.3.4.5
